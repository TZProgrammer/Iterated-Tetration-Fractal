# Iterated-Tetration-Fractal
Tetration is repeated exponentiation, just like exponentiation is repeated multiplication and multiplication is repeated addition. Spirals form by plotting the numbers found by iterating the tetration operator on a point in the complex plane. This project colours each pixel on a canvas according to the number of arms in the spirals generated at those coordinates, creating a never-before-seen fractal.
